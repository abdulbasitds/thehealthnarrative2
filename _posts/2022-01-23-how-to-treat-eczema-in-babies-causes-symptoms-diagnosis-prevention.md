## What does eczema looks like
ECZEMA IN BABIES
Eczema is an inflammatory skin condition that causes itchy, dry, scaly patches. It gets worse and settles down from time to time. Up to 90 % of cases occur before five years of age and more than half of children grow out of it by the time they reach teenage.

 

## WHAT CAUSES ECZEMA?
There is no single cause for eczema. Certain genetic mutations, environmental factors, and hypersensitive immune responses are the major players.

Eczema tends to run in families and most children with eczema also have other allergic conditions such as asthma and hay fever.

 

## WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS OF ECZEMA?

![alt text](../../../images/eczema-image-1-610x343.jpg)

- Dry skin
- Red dry scaly patches
- Itching- if it does not itch eczema is unlikely
- Thickening of skin (due to repeated scratching) is called lichenification (meaning leather skin)
- Patches of inflamed skin can form blisters that weep, and a superimposed infection can occur
 

## WHICH AREAS OF SKIN ARE USUALLY INVOLVED

### CHILDREN UNDER 1 YEAR
In infants, face, scalp, and extensor surfaces (outer side like the front of the knee, back of elbows) are involved.

### CHILDREN ABOVE 1 YEAR
In children flexure surfaces (folds of elbows, back of knees) and neck folds, wrists and ankles are involved.

Age wise distribution

## HOW ECZEMA IS DIAGNOSED?
Usually, the doctor diagnoses it based on history and by examining the lesion. In some cases, a patch test is done to find out the allergen.

If your child is experiencing symptoms for the first time please visit your doctor.

 

## WHAT TRIGGERS ECZEMA?
- Soaps and detergents.
- Extremes of weather, winters, and excessive sweating in summers can also cause a flare-up.
- Contact allergen like nickel, perfumes, etc.
- Irritating fabric like wool.
- Dietary factors.
- Inhaled allergen like pollens, dust mites, pets dander, etc.
- nfection.
- Stress.

## WHAT FOODS TO AVOID?
Watch out for foods that trigger eczema in your child, however, the most common foods that trigger flare-ups are nuts, eggs, cow’s milk, fish, wheat, and soy.

 

HOW TO PREVENT ECZEMA?
Two important factors that significantly reduce the number of flare-ups are:

 

## AVOID TRIGGERS

- Avoid the allergens mentioned above as much as possible.
- Do not give child hot baths instead use Luke-warm water. Keep the bath time short and do not use harsh soaps.
- Make the child wear loose cotton clothes.
- Keep nails short, vigorous scratching can also aggravate eczema plus it can cause skin breaks that can get infected
- Avoid infection.
- Help the child avoid stress.
 

## MOISTURIZE
- Keep the skin moisturized, apply emollients regularly even when there are no symptoms and the skin looks clear.
- The best time to apply emollients is when it is moist, emollients are well-absorbed when applied on damp skin.


## HOW ECZEMA IS TREATED?
 

For management of flare-up and worsening symptoms, topical steroids and emollients remain the mainstay of treatment.

Usually, mild topical corticosteroids are recommended for a short duration (5 to 7 days) to be applied once or twice daily.

Moderate and potent corticosteroids are reserved for severe cases.

In cases of flare-ups, the doctor might switch the emollient to the one that has higher lipid content and will advise to apply it more often.

In cases of an infection, a topical antibiotic is also added.

 

## WARNING
If you are using moderate or potent corticosteroid or mild corticosteroid for a longer duration please see your doctor regularly. That is because corticosteroids get absorbed into the system through the skin and can have systemic side effects.

## HOW TO STOP ITCHING IN ECZEMA?
Usually, moisturization and topical steroids help with itching but in cases of severe itching, the doctor might prescribe oral antihistamine syrup/tablets to be taken before bed.

## HOW TO APPLY EMOLLIENT AND STEROID TOGETHER?
Apply emollient first and let it sink in for 30 minutes and then apply topical corticosteroid.
