## Does sunlight cause skin cancer? All you should know about sunlightâ€™s effect on skin

![alt text](../../../images/skin-cancer-thumb-nail.png)

UV radiation is a strong risk factor for the development of common skin cancers such as squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma. UV radiations cause DNA damage and mutation which can lead to abnormal growth of skin cells and therefore cancer formation.

However, there are other risk factors as well such as genetic predisposition, advanced age, male gender, smoking, immunosuppression, and exposure to certain chemicals. For skin cancers, genetic predisposition is another important risk factor. People of Caucasian origin who have type 1 and type 2 skin (skin that burns at sun exposure and never tans or tans minimally) are, particularly at higher risk.

## ARE COLOURED PEOPLE PROTECTED?

Melanin is a skin pigment produced by special skin cells known as melanocytes. The darker is the skin color the more is the melanin produced by melanocytes. Melanin acts as a UV absorbent and protects skin against UV damage, not only that it has antioxidant effects as well. Therefore, the risk of developing skin cancers is significantly low in dark-skinned people.

## HOW TO PROTECT SKIN FROM SUN?

Always wear high factor sunscreen (at least SPF 30) and apply it generously on sun-exposed skin.

UV radiation is strongest between 10 AM to 4 PM. Try to stay indoors during this time.

Wear protective clothing like long sleeves, trousers, brimmed hats, etc.

Wear sunglasses that filter UV radiation

## DOES AVOIDING SUNLIGHT PROTECT AGAINST SKIN CANCER COMPLETELY?

Avoiding sunlight can significantly reduce the risk of skin cancer but like mentioned earlier there are other risk factors too. So a skin cancer can still develop but that does not undermine the significance of protecting ourselves from sunlight.

## HOW DO I KNOW IF I HAVE SKIN CANCER?

The most important symptom of skin cancer is a persistent skin lesion.

If you have a skin lesion, nodule, patch, or sore that does not go away or has formed an ulcer that oozes or bleeds you should visit your GP.

## MOLE VS MELANOMA

Certainly, every mole is not melanoma. You can watch out for the following signs, which make mole suspicious for melanoma.

Size larger than 6mm or growing rapidly in size

Irregular in shape

Has more than one shade/color

changing shape, color or appearance
