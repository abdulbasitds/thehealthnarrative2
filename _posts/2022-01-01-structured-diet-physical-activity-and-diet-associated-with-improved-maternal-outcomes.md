Excessive gestational weight gain (weight gain in pregnancy ) is common and associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.
A metanalysis published in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) looked at 117 randomized clinical trials involving 34 546 pregnancies and found Structured diet, physical activity, and diet with physical activity were all associated with improved maternal outcomes.
Antenatal structured diet and physical activity-based lifestyle interventions were associated with reduced gestational weight gain and with maternal and neonatal benefits.
Structured diet interventions appeared to have greater implications for gestational weight gain than physical activity alone or mixed interventions.
Diet was associated with improved maternal and neonatal outcomes, whereas physical activity was associated with improved adverse maternal outcomes.
