On the two-year anniversary of the first recorded coronavirus outbreak, when China first reported a cluster of “viral pneumonia” the World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom says he is optimistic that the coronavirus pandemic will be defeated in 2022.

He said “Narrow nationalism and vaccine hoarding by some countries have undermined equity and created the ideal conditions for the emergence of the Omicron variant, and the longer inequity continues, the higher the risks of the virus evolving in ways we can’t prevent or predict.If we end inequity, we end the pandemic”

Global Covid cases now stand at 287m, while nearly 5.5m people have died.
The goal for 2022 is to vaccinate 70% of people in all countries by July to end the pandemic.
