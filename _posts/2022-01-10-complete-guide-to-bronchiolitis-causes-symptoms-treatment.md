## Bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of lower respiratory infection in children under 2 years of age. It most commonly occurs between the ages of 3 to 6 months. Most cases occur in winters.

What is the cause of bronchiolitis?
It is caused by a virus called Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in 80% of the cases. By the age of 2 years, every child gets infected with RSV and at least half of them develop bronchiolitis.

Other viruses that can cause bronchiolitis include adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, and influenza virus.

 

## Which component of the respiratory system is infected in bronchiolitis?
The infection causes inflammation of small air passages called bronchioles in the lungs. The inflammation causes the bronchioles to produce more and more mucus which clogs the air passage, making it difficult to breathe.

## What are the symptoms of bronchiolitis?

It starts with flu-like symptoms like runny/stuffy nose, cough low-grade fever, and then progresses to chest congestion and noisy breathing. In severe cases, it can cause difficulty in breathing.

### How long does bronchiolitis last?
Symptoms peak at around the 3rd to 5th day of infection and usually, it takes 1 to 2 weeks to settle down. However, in severe cases, it might take longer.  In some kids, cough lingers for weeks.

### How bronchiolitis is diagnosed?
Usually, it is a clinical diagnosis which means the doctor will make a diagnosis based on history and examination. In a few settings, however, a swab test might be done to identify the type e virus but since it does not change the management, it is not usually done.

Oxygen saturation is checked by pulse oximetry to assess the severity; furthermore, an x-ray might be needed to rule out pneumonia.

 

## Can bronchiolitis be treated at home?
Most cases can be managed at home. The following will help you get through it.

### Pain and fever medication
Monitor fever at home. You can give your child over-the-counter pain and fever medication like acetaminophen (Panadol, Tylenol) or ibuprofen. Do not exceed the mentioned dose.

Do not give aspirin to a child until prescribed by the doctor.

### Maintain hydration
Make sure the child is drinking and feeding well. Offer small frequent fluids and meals.

### Nebulize
Nebulization with normal saline significantly reduces the symptoms of nose and chest congestion.

### Saline nose drops
These are available over the counter and help relieve nasal congestion. Put two drops in each nostril before every feed. You can also use bulb suction right after you put the drops.

### Humidifier
A Humidifier keeps the surrounding air moist which helps with the congestion.

### Prop up the head
Due to the clogging of the mucus behind the nose child has difficulty sleeping. Elevating the head side of the cot a little can help. Do not elevate if a child is under 1 year of age.

Do not smoke at home
Smoke can cause irritation of the airways and further aggravate symptoms.

## When to call the hospital?
Call/take the child to the hospital in case of the following.

- Fast Rapid breathing up to 60 per minute.
- The areas between the ribs are sinking in while breathing.
- The persistent temperature of 38C/100.4 or above.

- he Child is very fussy and irritable.
- The Child looks very lethargic and tired.
- The Child’s tongue or lips appear blue.
 

## Hospital treatment of bronchiolitis
In the hospital, nebulized racemic adrenaline is administered, hydration is maintained through IV fluids, suctioning of mucus is done via a tube and supplemental oxygen is administered as required.

## Bronchiolitis is contagious
Take the following measures to prevent bronchiolitis.

Avoid close contact of babies with people who have a fever or flu-like symptoms
Wash hands frequently.
Cover your mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing.
Disinfect toys and surfaces where possible.
