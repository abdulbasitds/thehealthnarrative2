The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorized Merck’s antiviral pill, Molnupiravir, for the treatment of mild-to-moderate coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on Thursday. This is the second covid-19 antiviral pill authorized by FDA.
Earlier, on Wednesday, the FDA authorized Pfizer’s antiviral pill, Paxlovid (a combination of a new antiviral drug named Nirmatrelvir and an older one ritonavir).
These are the first antiviral Covid-19 pills authorized in the US for ill people to take at home before they get sick enough to be hospitalized.
Patients who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death are eligible for these drugs and will need to have prescribed by a doctor.
