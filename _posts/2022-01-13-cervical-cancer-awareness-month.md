**January** is Cervical Cancer Awareness Month. Here is what you must know about Cervical cancer.

In 2020, around **604 000** women were diagnosed with cervical cancer worldwide and about **342 000** women died from the disease. More than 90% of deaths occur in low and middle income countries.

More than **99%** of cervical cancer are caused by infection with **Human papillomavirus virus (HPV)**.

HPV infection is extremely common throughout the world. Most sexually active adults will have an HPV infection at some point during their lives.
Infection is asymptomatic in most cases.

Vaccination against carcinogenic HPV can prevent cervical cancer.

HPV vaccines can be given starting at age 9 years uptill age 26 years. HPV vaccination is not recommended for everyone older than age 26 years as HPV vaccination in this age range provides less benefit, as more people have already been exposed to HPV.

### Screening

Screening programs can detect early signs of the disease allowing time for effective treatment.

Screening is done by two tests starting at the age of 21. One is a Pap smear (detects pre-cancer cells) the other is an HPV test ( detects virus).

Ages 21 to 30
Pap smear every 3 years.

Age above 30
Pap smear every 3 years or HPV every 5 years.
